              Hello, I'm Ismail Ista, a passionate full-stack developer based in
              Casablanca, Morocco. In 2022, I earned my specialized diploma in
              software development from ISTA, marking the beginning of my
              journey into the world of programming. Driven by a genuine love
              for coding and problem-solving, I decided to enhance my skills
              further. In 2023, I completed the JobInTech Bootcamp,
              specializing in the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js)
              stack. This intensive experience has equipped me with a solid
              foundation in modern web development.

              efficiently managing coaches, courses, and schedules, providing a
              streamlined process before the commencement of teaching at ISTA.
